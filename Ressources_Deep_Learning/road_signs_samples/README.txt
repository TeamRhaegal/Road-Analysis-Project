 This folder contains the various tests of algorithms for locating and classifying traffic signs.

To work, the latest "roadsign_detector" code needs : 
- Tensorflow in version less than 2.0: 1.9, 1.4, 1.3 ... (for compatibility concerns) 
- Keras in version 2.3 or higher
- the "Tensorflow_models" package that can be found here : https://github.com/tensorflow/models 

WARNING : Installation of "Tensorflow_models" can be long and difficult for beginners. You can follow this tutorial if you need help : https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

Don't forget to change the paths to the different models and parameters in the "roadsign_detector.py" code to match your file architecture.
