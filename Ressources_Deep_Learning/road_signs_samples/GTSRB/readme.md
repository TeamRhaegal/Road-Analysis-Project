# German Road sign database for machine learning

This dataset contains about : 
  * 51 000 road sign images : 
     * 31 000 images for learning purpose
     * 12 000 images for testing purpose
  
 From this dataset, we will try to use one of the tutorial (on the web) to train a model to recognise and classify road signs,
 using Python and some libraries as Tensorflow, Keras, Pandas ... . 
 For example, we can take the one from [this website](https://chsasank.github.io/keras-tutorial.html).
 
 We will train a model to recognise road sign. To achieve this, we need to process as many images as possible in a convolutional neural network. 
 One of the constraints is that all images must be of the same size for the model to learn something coherent.
 
 We will use images described by the HSV model rather than the RGB model. This makes it easier to describe an image and avoid relying on RGB values that are very difficult to achieve "perfectly" in general.
