#German Road sign database for machine learning

This dataset contains about : 
  ..*51 000 road sign images : 
  ..*..* 31 000 images for learning purpose
  ..*..* 12 000 images for testing purpose
  
 From this dataset, we will try to use one of the tutorial (on the web) to train a model to recognise and classify road signs,
 using Python and some libraries as Tensorflow, Keras, Pandas ... . 
 For example, we can take the one from [this website](https://chsasank.github.io/keras-tutorial.html).
